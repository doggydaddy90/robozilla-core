# Packaged Orgs (Sellable Units)
#
# Packaged organizations are the sellable unit. Each package should include an
# Organization Manifest plus any package-owned assets (schemas, prompts, etc.)
# in a versionable layout.
#
# Macro-domain membership should be expressed via `metadata.labels.macro_domain`.
